vT1.0
  - Removed redundant in-container logging. Logs are handled by docker.
  - Fixed BitPing service for aarch64.
  - Updated traffmonetizer config for more resilience. Previously an in-line comment in config file, if not removed by user, could break functionality.
  - Logs mention the service name for clarity.
